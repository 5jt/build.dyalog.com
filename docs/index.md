# System building with Dyalog APL

## Hello you


You want to write an application in Dyalog APL. You have already learned enough of the language to put some of your specialist knowledge into functions you can use in your work. The code works for you. Now you want to turn it into an application others can use. Perhaps even sell it. 

We assume 

-   you don’t have experience in software development
-   your code is in one or more saved workspaces and that you run it in the session

## Setting up

RIDE (the Dyalog IDE) has all you need for writing and editing functions. 
Saved workspaces contain snapshots of all your variables and functions; even suspended evaluations.

But now we’ll set you up with tools for managing your project professionally.
Or, if you are already familiar with development environments such as VS Code, we’ll show you how to set them up to work wth Dyalog APL.

## From logic to application

We’ll step through the process of taking your coded logic and turning it into a tool, package, application or service others can use – and perhaps pay you for.

-   Manage your source code in text files
-   Document your code 
-   Log what happens when you run it
-   Trap and report errors
-   Provide a graphical user interface
-   Provide a Help subsystem
-   Provide configuration options
-   Package a desktop application for macOS or Windows
-   Provide automatic updates
-   Make your code available as a service on the Web
-   Run your code in a platform-independent container
-   Publish your service on a cloud platform
