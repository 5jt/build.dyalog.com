# Tatin package

![Tatin logo](../img/tatin.png)

A software _package_ is a collection of related code objects: variables, functions, operators, and so on.

[Tatin](https://tatin.dev) is the [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager "Wikipedia") for Dyalog. 
Publishing your code as a Tatin package, makes it available to other APL programmers.

The functions are perfect for your use.
They pass the tests you have written for them.
They waste no time or code validating their arguments: you know what arguments to give them. 

Everything you need and nothing more.

But your fellow APL user could use some guidance.

For functions as trivial as these, a few lines of comments would suffice.
But these functions are *place holders* for your more interesting code, so weâ€™ll assume more needs saying. 

The Tatin package [ADoc](https://github.com/aplteam/ADOC "GitHub") provides automatic documentation tools and hooks for your code.

ADoc is available in your session as a user command. 
Try:

	]ADoc -?

See the Tatin guide to [publishing your package](https://tatin.dev/v1/Assets//docs/PublishingPackages.html).
