A software _package_ is a collection of related code objects: variables, functions, operators, and so on.

[Tatin](https://tatin.dev) is the [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager "Wikipedia") for Dyalog. 
Publishing your code as a Tatin package, makes it available to other APL programmers.

Your code is perfect for you
