# Example application


In this section we take a collection of functions and turn them into different forms of usable software. 

The functions here represent _your_ functions: code you have written and use in your work. 
Your _actual_ functions will be much more interesting than these.
Our examples are chosen to be simple without quite being trivial.[^code]

[^code]: We make no attempt to explain the code itself. If you want to explore that, try the resources of [learn.dyalog.com](https://learn.dyalog.com).

The functions here calculate [descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics "Wikipedia") of the simplest kind. 
(Some of the functions are no more than [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar "Wikipedia").)

The functions are perfect for your use.
Everything you need and nothing more.
They pass the tests you have written for them.

We proceed in stages.

-   Share with other APL programmers as a [Tatin](https://tatin.dev) package
-   Provide as a DSL to other APL users
-   Publish as a desktop application
-   Provide as a Web or intranet application
-   Provide as a Web API
