# System building with Dyalog APL


![Paula](img/paula.jpg){: style="border: 1px solid #eee"}

## Hello you


You want to write an application in Dyalog APL. 
You have already succeeded in turning some of your specialist knowledge into functions that help your work. 
The code works for you! 

Now you want to take your code to the next level. 
At the very least make it more robust and handy for your own use.
Possibly turn it into an application others can use.
Maybe even pay you for! 

We assume 

-   you don’t have experience in software development
-   your code is in stored by Link in text files and that you run it in the session

(If you haven’t got this far yet, the resources at [learn.dyalog.com](https://learn.dyalog.com) are probably more helpful.)


## Minimum developer skills

You’re not a professional software developer. 
You don’t want to *become* one. 
Does that mean you need to hire a software developer to continue?

It does not. Our aim here – extending what you’ve already achieved – is to introduce the minimum skills you need to turn your code into Your Application. 


## What’s here

[Tools](workbench.md)
: Profit from the experience of seasoned APL developers – adopt their tools!

[Articles](articles/index.md)
: Introducing the various aspects of producing a software application.

[System functions](sysfns/index.md)
: The most useful code packages are built right into the interpreter, always there.

[Library](library/index.md)
: Code packages for common tasks: no need to reinvent the wheel.

[Examples](examples/index.md)
: We take a tiny group of functions and turn them into a code package, a DSL, a desktop application, a Web application, and a Web service (API).

*[DSL]: Domain-specific language
<!-- 
## Setting up

RIDE (the Dyalog IDE) has all you need for writing and editing functions. 
Saved workspaces contain snapshots of all your variables and functions; even suspended evaluations.

But now we’ll set you up with tools for managing your project professionally.
Or, if you are already familiar with development environments such as VS Code, we’ll show you how to set them up to work wth Dyalog APL.

## From logic to application

We’ll step through the process of taking your coded logic and turning it into a tool, package, application or service others can use – and perhaps pay you for.

-   Manage your source code in text files
-   Document your code 
-   Log what happens when you run it
-   Trap and report errors
-   Provide a graphical user interface
-   Provide a Help subsystem
-   Provide configuration options
-   Package a desktop application for macOS or Windows
-   Provide automatic updates
-   Make your code available as a service on the Web
-   Run your code in a platform-independent container
-   Publish your service on a cloud platform -->
