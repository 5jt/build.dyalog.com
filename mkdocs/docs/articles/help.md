!!! abstract "You know how to use your code. What and how should you tell your user?"

What you tell your user will depend upon how you make the code available to her. 

-   If she writes APL then [formal documentation](https://github.com/aplteam/ADOC) might be best.
-   If you provide an application with a GUI you could equip it with a Help subsystem and hints on the controls.
-   If you offer an API, you could use the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (Swagger) to describe it, and make error messages as helpful as possible.
