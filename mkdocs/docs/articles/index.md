# Make your code usable


!!! abstract "Making your code usable by others means solving certain problems."


:fontawesome-solid-bomb: Handling errors
: If your code breaks when someone else is running it, you want to know about the problem so you can investigate it.


:fontawesome-solid-rectangle-list: Logging
: Have your code write a log of what itâ€™s doing. Investigating a problem becomes immensely easier.


:fontawesome-solid-clipboard-check: Validate inputs
: You know what your code is for; you pass it only suitable data.

	But your user might not be so clear. 
	Protect her from crashes by validating what she puts in. 


:fontawesome-solid-life-ring: Help
: You know how to use your code. What should you tell your user and how?
