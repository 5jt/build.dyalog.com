!!! abstract "What to do when your code breaks in someone else’s hands"


If your code breaks when you‘re running it in the workspace, you investigate the suspended state.
But if your code breaks when someone *else* is running it, you want to know about the problem so you can investigate it.

If your user is familiar with APL, she can simply save and send you the workspace with all the state suspended. 

Otherwise, you need a way to get the state saved for examination, and to restore control to the user.
